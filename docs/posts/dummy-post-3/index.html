<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Wanna rock 'n' roll? Alright!</p>
<p>G-B-V! G-B-V!</p>
<p>G-B-V! G-B-V!</p>
<p>Is anybody ready to rock?</p>
<p>This song does not rock</p>
<p>From eight, nine</p>
<p>G-B-V! G-B-V!</p>
<p>G-B-V! G-B-V!</p>
<h2>Over the Neptune</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>Traveller's diagram</p>
<p>For where I am, for what I am</p>
<p>Pictoral visual codes</p>
<p>It overloads, it all explodes</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>And hey, let's throw the great party</p>
<p>Today for the rest of our lives</p>
<p>The fun is just about to get started</p>
<p>So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>Special elixirs flow</p>
<p>And then the onion lady blows</p>
<p>Kisses to the crying cooks</p>
<p>With baited hooks and lady looks</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>And hey, let's throw the great party</p>
<p>Today for the rest of our lives</p>
<p>The fun is just about to get started</p>
<p>So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time, hey!</p>
<h2>Mesh Gear Fox</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>You must be willing just to ride along with me</p>
<p>You must be happy just to do the job for free</p>
<p>Yours for the taking if you follow simple rules</p>
<p>Such acts of subservience were never taught in schools</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>You spit me out from your cosmos</p>
<p>You draft me in for your troops</p>
<p>Set me up for the knockdown</p>
<p>You can watch, you can watch</p>
<p>But I'll be back when it's over</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>
<p>I'm much greater than you think</p>
<p>I'm a slammer in the drink</p>
<p>I'm much greater than you think</p>
<p>I'm a slammer in the drink</p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>And oh, mesh gear fox</p>
<p>Pull out another bag of tricks from your scientific box</p>
<p>Time's wasting and you're not gonna live forever</p>
<p>And if you do</p>
<p>I'll come back and marry you</p>
<p>No use changing now, you couldn't anyhow and ever</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>It's not the way that I feel, that I feel</p>
<p>It's the way you act, it's the way you look when you're near me</p>
<p>It's not so hard to conceal, to conceal</p>
<p>It's the things you say, it's the things you do, go right through me</p>
