<h2>Over the Neptune</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>Traveller's diagram For where I am, for what I am Pictoral visual codes It overloads, it all explodes</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>And hey, let's throw the great party Today for the rest of our lives The fun is just about to get started So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>Special elixirs flow And then the onion lady blows Kisses to the crying cooks With baited hooks and lady looks</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>And hey, let's throw the great party Today for the rest of our lives The fun is just about to get started So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time, hey!</p>
<h2>Mesh Gear Fox</h2>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>You must be willing just to ride along with me You must be happy just to do the job for free Yours for the taking if you follow simple rules Such acts of subservience were never taught in schools</p>
<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p>You spit me out from your cosmos You draft me in for your troops Set me up for the knockdown You can watch, you can watch But I'll be back when it's over</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>
<p>I'm much greater than you think I'm a slammer in the drink I'm much greater than you think I'm a slammer in the drink</p>
<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p>And oh, mesh gear fox Pull out another bag of tricks from your scientific box Time's wasting and you're not gonna live forever And if you do I'll come back and marry you No use changing now, you couldn't anyhow and ever</p>
<h3>Chorus</h3>
<p>It's not the way that I feel, that I feel It's the way you act, it's the way you look when you're near me It's not so hard to conceal, to conceal It's the things you say, it's the things you do, go right through me</p>
