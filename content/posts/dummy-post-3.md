# And another one...

## Intro

Wanna rock 'n' roll? Alright!
G-B-V! G-B-V!
G-B-V! G-B-V!
Is anybody ready to rock?
This song does not rock
From eight, nine
G-B-V! G-B-V!
G-B-V! G-B-V!

## Over the Neptune

### Verse 1
Traveller's diagram
For where I am, for what I am
Pictoral visual codes
It overloads, it all explodes

### Chorus
And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time

### Verse 2
Special elixirs flow
And then the onion lady blows
Kisses to the crying cooks
With baited hooks and lady looks

### Chorus
And hey, let's throw the great party
Today for the rest of our lives
The fun is just about to get started
So throw the switch, it's rock and roll time, hey!

## Mesh Gear Fox

### Verse 1
You must be willing just to ride along with me
You must be happy just to do the job for free
Yours for the taking if you follow simple rules
Such acts of subservience were never taught in schools

### Verse 2
You spit me out from your cosmos
You draft me in for your troops
Set me up for the knockdown
You can watch, you can watch
But I'll be back when it's over

### Bridge
I'm much greater than you think
I'm a slammer in the drink
I'm much greater than you think
I'm a slammer in the drink

### Verse 3
And oh, mesh gear fox
Pull out another bag of tricks from your scientific box
Time's wasting and you're not gonna live forever
And if you do
I'll come back and marry you
No use changing now, you couldn't anyhow and ever

### Chorus
It's not the way that I feel, that I feel
It's the way you act, it's the way you look when you're near me
It's not so hard to conceal, to conceal
It's the things you say, it's the things you do, go right through me

### Solo
